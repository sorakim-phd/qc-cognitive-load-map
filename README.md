# QC Cognitive Load Map

*Mapping cognitive load in highly regulated organizational systems*

This project develops a computational and conceptual model of how cognitive load accumulates in highly regulated organizational systems.

Rather than treating errors as individual failures, the model examines how documentation demands, procedural fragmentation, task switching, and accountability structures shape judgment under regulation.

## Research Questions

- How does regulatory structure redistribute cognitive load across tasks and decisions?
- Why do recurrent errors persist despite training and procedural reinforcement?
- How do organizational accountability mechanisms favor individual attribution over systemic explanations?

## Approach

- Synthetic workflow generation based on highly regulated organizational environments
- Parameterization of cognitive load (task switching, documentation density, temporal pressure)
- Simulation-based analysis of error-prone conditions

## Status

This project is in active development.  
Initial modeling and simulation scaffolding are underway.

## What is an SOP?

In regulated laboratory environments, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) define approved workflows, testing steps, and documentation requirements intended to ensure consistency and compliance.

In practice, however, SOPs often specify *what must be done* without fully resolving *how ambiguous or exceptional situations should be judged*. As a result, practitioners are frequently required to interpret procedures and make judgment calls that are not explicitly addressed in written guidance.
